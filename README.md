//Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This is the Investment Calculator from project 2 of my CS 210 class. It takes user input for inital investment amount, intrest rate, number of years, and monthly deposits. It will output tables that show how the investment grows.

//What did you do particularly well?
The functionality and readability of this code turned out well.

//Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
To enhance my code further, adding further input vaildation for more senarios and utilizing the try catch methods. Also futher formatting of my tables would provide for a better user experience. I am certain there is more I could do to improve that I may not have noticed at this time.

/*Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?*/
The most challenging part of this project was getting my function call to display my table information working correctly. Initially, I was carried away and wrote the program without using a class to shorten my main. Obviously I realized this, but had to re-work though it all to correct this massive mistake. Upon correcting this, and adjusting names of variables and functions, I found out any output in my loop within the function output nothing. It took me more time to figure out how to get this working properly and outputting the calculations, than everything else in this project. I haved added code academy and cplusplus.com to my supporting resources since this project.

//What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project helped me think over more clearly my overall project. Creating pseudocode not only helps this process, but helped in my understanding of how I needed to make it work. The struggles I came across, helped me grown and learn, and in turn shifted my approach towards my course work. It further developed my skill level, which I knew nothing of C++ prior to this class. It challenged me, and the compleation of this project was extremly rewarding, not just in the sense of knowledge.

//How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the code to the specifications required for consistancy, spaced things out in a clear way, and kept things as concise as I could without destroying the nameing methods. By utilizing classes and functions/function calls, it should be easier to adapt the program to any desired changes. I utilzied header files when creating my class, which will also aid in updating features to this program.
